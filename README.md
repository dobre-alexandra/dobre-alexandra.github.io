## Projects

#### [Machine Learning for Fake News Detection (April 2025)](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/fakenews-detection-ML)
*Tools: Python (NLTK, pandas, numpy), Apache Spark (PySpark, MLlib), Google Cloud Platform (GCS)*

* [Report](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/ai-stock-portfolio/blob/main/report.pdf), [Github Repository](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/fakenews-detection-ML)
* Developed a scalable fake news detection pipeline in Python using Apache Spark MLlib with over 98% accuracy, using Natural Language Processing techniques with feature engineering from article metadata to predict article accuracy.
* Analyzed Logistic Regression and Random Forest model interpretability by extracting coefficients and feature importances, revealing key predictors of fake news, such as sensationalist stylistic elements and temporal patterns.

#### [Scalable Credit Card Fraud Detection with Distributed Machine Learning (May 2025)](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/creditcard-fraud-ML)
*Tools: Python (pandas, NumPy, imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn), Apache Spark (PySpark, MLlib), Google Cloud Platform (Dataproc, GCS)*

* [Report](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/creditcard-fraud-ML/blob/main/reports/final_report.pdf), [Github Repository](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/creditcard-fraud-ML))
* Developed a scalable credit card fraud detection pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) leveraging Apache Spark (PySpark) to process and analyze a 4-million-row credit card transaction dataset.
* Engineered a data augmentation strategy combining Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and bootstrapping to address extreme class imbalance (0.17% fraud rate), significantly enhancing model learning without degrading test set realism.
* Evaluated Logistic Regression, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Isolation Forest models for performance and scalability, analyzing training times and resource utilization (CPU, Disk I/O, YARN memory) across varying data sizes and worker nodes

#### [Personalized Stock Portfolio Optimization (January 2025)](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/ai-stock-portfolio/tree/main)
*Tools: Python (pandas, NumPy, CVXPY), GLPK, Google Colab*

* [Report](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/ai-stock-portfolio/blob/main/report.pdf), [Github Repository](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/ai-stock-portfolio/tree/main)
* Engineered an AI-driven Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework in Python using CVXPY and GLPK to personalize stock portfolio allocations, optimizing for user-defined risk and returns.
* Designed an interactive Python tool integrating financial stock data and user input to generate optimal, diversified portfolios using mathematical optimization, data manipulation, and financial modeling.

#### [Social Network Analysis: Eurovision Voting Networks](https://github.com/dobre-alexandra/eurovision-network-analysis)
*Tools: R (igraph, knitr, dplyr), RStudio — May 2025*
* Conducted a comprehensive social network analysis in R using `igraph` to visualize and analyze historical Eurovision voting patterns, uncovering nuanced geospatial relationships and voting blocs based on public and jury data (1957-2023).
* Applied community detection algorithms (Spinglass) and quantitative measures (reciprocity, assortativity) to identify latent alliances within the voting network, providing insights into cultural and regional influences on international competitions.

## Work Experience
**Research Analyst @ U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (_July 2022 - August 2024_)**
- Led analysis on mortgage market research and 10+ fair lending examinations, developing advanced statistical models and using causal inference techniques in R and Stata to assess discrimination risk in the mortgage market.
- Applied causal inference techniques, including nearest-neighbor matching, to quantify financial damages from discriminatory lending and identify interest rate disparities.
- Optimized large-scale data processing workflows using SQL and Python, cleaning and integrating millions of unstructured mortgage loan records with regulatory home mortgage data.
- Translated complex statistical findings into clear, actionable financial market regulatory policy insights for attorneys, drafting detailed memos and presenting analyses in written, tabular, and graphical formats.
- Authored government reports and peer-reviewed research on market segmentation and consumer lending trends, and presenting results to diverse audiences including industry leaders, economists, and the general public.
- Led cross-functional collaboration with IT engineers and analysts on a 12-week cloud-based big data system transition, coordinating testing, analyzing performance on 100+ million records, and presenting recommendations to leadership.

**Research Assistant @ U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (_May 2020 - July 2022_)**
- Performed data cleaning and analysis on multiple waves of the [Bureau’s Making Ends Meet survey](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4031924), linking survey responses to millions of credit bureau records to generate insights on credit card and mortgage markets.
- Supported PhD economists in drafting internal memos on underwriting and pricing disparities for prohibited basis groups, preparing written and graphical reports for attorneys.
- Administered the Office of Research's Linux computing environment, providing training, troubleshooting, and performance monitoring for 100+ users across complex distributed systems.
- Managed the construction of the Bureau's [HMDA Reporter Panel](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-publication/snapshot-national-loan-level-dataset/2021) dataset, executing code to integrate multiple regulatory mortgage data sources covering 5,000+ lenders, and automating the reconciliation of conflicting reporter identifiers.
- Co-authored a [Bureau report](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4031924) on credit characteristics of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the mortgage market, coordinated the review and timely release of the report with internal stakeholders.
